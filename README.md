# advance-CSS-portfolio-1
Advanced CSS project

## Description

This project is my first attempt to build a portfolio to display what I have learned in the coding bootcamp. 

- I have learned that coding can be fun, but also hard. 
- I have a lot more to learn about pseudo-coding and making sure my layout is well organized prior to coding. 
- This was fun!

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is my initial portfolio attempt during the coding bootcamp. HTML and CSS were used from scratch to design and develop this version of the portfolio.
